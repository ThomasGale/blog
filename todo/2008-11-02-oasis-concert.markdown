Went to see Oasis at the Exhibition Centre last night, it was an amazing concert!!!

 

This was the first time that I had seen Oasis, and I was really looking forward to it, and they didn't disappoint!!! They played a few of their new songs, which unfortunately I had heard, as I haven't picked up the new album yet, but they also played some of their classics. Don''t Look Back In Anger, Champagne SuperNova, Wonderwall, I am a Walrus...

 

It was great!!!

 

Only slight downer on the evening was that I must have got hit by about 10 pints of what I am hoping was beer. Had to go home and have a shower after the concert!!
