It has come round quicker then I thought it was going to, but we are here.

Tonight is the first meeting of the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group, and I am doing the presentation.Â  Details can be found here:

There are still a couple of spaces left, so if you want to come along, it would be great to see you there.

EDIT: This meeting was listed on the Aberdeen Developers site before it was moved over to the BlogEngine site, as a result, details of the event are no longer available.
