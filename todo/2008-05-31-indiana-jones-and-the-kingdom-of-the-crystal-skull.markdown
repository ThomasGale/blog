I went to see the new [Indiana Jones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/) film today, and although I have heard some people say that they didn't enjoy it because it was too far fetched, I have to say that I did enjoy it!!

 

Granted, the massive alien space at the end was maybe a little bit over the top, but then again, the same could be said about finding the Ark of the Covenant, or the Cup of Christ.

 

Anyway, if you don't mind a bit of a far fetched story line, I would go and see it. Harrison Ford, although looking a bit old, does a good job!!
