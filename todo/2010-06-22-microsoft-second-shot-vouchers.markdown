If anyone is thinking about sitting a Microsoft Exam in the near future, you might want to think about taking advantage of the Microsoft Second Shot Voucher scheme.Â  Details can be found here:

This scheme is set to end on the 30th June, so you will have to act fast.

EDIT: This offer seems to have now ended, and the link that previously worked now doesn't.
