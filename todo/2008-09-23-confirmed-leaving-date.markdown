Woot Woot!! I have now got a confirmed date for when I leaving Calgary!! Getting on the plane on the night of the 18th October. Can't wait to get home!! The whole trip has been a great experience, but it is time for this Scottish loon to make his way home to familiar shores. Would definitely come back to Canada if I get a chance though, it's a really nice place!!
