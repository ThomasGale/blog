Today I bought myself a PlayStation 3!!!

 

Debated for a long time which would be the best thing to get. An XBox 360? A PlayStation 3? A standalone Blu-ray Player?

 

In the end, decided the PS3 would be the best, as this would give me the option of sharing files from my server, playing Blu-ray disks, and also playing the odd game. Although, to be fair, most gaming is done on the Wii, so will see how that works out.

 

Got it all hooked up today, but having some problems getting the latest firmware installed on it, going to have to look into this. Might have to temporarily use a Ethernet cable to get it installed.
