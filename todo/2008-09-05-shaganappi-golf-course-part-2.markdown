Went back and played the back nine again here this morning. This time it was only me and one other guy from the office. Sun rises are starting to get later now, so we didn't actually get started until 7:30am, but we were still back in the office by 09:30am, which isn't too bad. Think we are going to look to move to playing at the weekend at some point so that more people can come along.

 

Played better this time round, had a 43 for the back nine, which isn't bad, although my driving was pitiful, couldn't hit any woods, so moved down to the trusty 4 iron off the tee, which seemed to work a little better.
