# My StyleCop Talk at DDDSW 4


On Saturday 26th May 2012, I did my first ever DDD talk, entitled “StyleCop: Breaking down the barriers to entry”.  If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing either the slide deck, or the source code for the presentation, you can find the information below.  If you did attend, let me just say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!


# The Code


The demonstrations that I did during the presentation, with the exception of the “real world” example, can be found on my GitHub account [here](http://gep13.me/StyleCopDemos).  In Demo 5b, the source code for StyleCop Contrib was a copy of the code which you can find [here](http://stylecopcontrib.codeplex.com/), and it was duplicated solely for demonstration purposes.


# The Slides


A full copy of the slides that were used on the day can be found as an attachment to this post, and you can see a preview of them below:

Feedback

Since this was my first talk at an event the size of DDDSW, I am very anxious to get some feedback about what I did wrong, what I did right, what could be improved upon etc, so if you were at my session, and have any comments, I would be very grateful to hear them.
