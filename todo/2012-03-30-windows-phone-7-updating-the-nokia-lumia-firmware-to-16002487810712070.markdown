This morning I found another notification to indicate that there was an update for my Windows Phone 7, Nokia Lumia 800 Handset.Â  Given the [recent announcement](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/nokia-lumia-800-to-get-tethering-support-soon/), I hurriedly set about getting the update installed.

In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here are some of the screenshots that I took along the update process:

As soon as the update was completed, and the Windows Phone 7 handset had rebooted, I straight away went into the Settings menu where I was sure that I was going to find the [Internet Sharing](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/) option, but unfortunately, it is still not there!

On doing some searching, I turned up this [Nokia Support Discussion](http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Heads-up-on-Lumia-800-update-1600-2487-8107-12070/td-p/1361057) which explains that this update does:


<blockquote>

> 
> 
	
>   * brings significant improvements in battery performance, especially in 3G talk time as well as in predictive usage time, standby time, WiFi browsing time and music playback time.
> 
	
>   * Improved bass in audio performance
> 
	
>   * The back, start, and search keys are lit according to screen brightness settings
> 
	
>   * Fix to prevent rebooting in certain network conditions
> 
	
>   * Fix for call hang up issues in certain markets
> 

</blockquote>


These things are all great, and I had actually noticed the rebooting of the phone when starting up initially, so I am glad that this is fixed, however, I still REALLY want to be able to tether my laptop to my Windows Phone 7.

Hopefully the next update from Nokia for the Windows Phone 7 will include this functionality, and further, I hope that my current mobile operator supports this function (which I have been told that they do).

For those interested in version numbers etc, this update took my Windows Phone 7 from:

Firmware Revision Number: **1600.2483.8106.11500 **to **1600.2487.8107.12070**
