Today was the first day of activities for the Calgary Stampede, and it started with the Parade. We were given this morning off so we could enjoy it, so I took full advantage of it. The prelude to the parade started at 0730, so I made sure that I got there early so I could get a good spot. Ended up standing behind the embankment at the bridge at 8th and 9th Avenue, which turned out to be a really good spot. You could see everything as they came over the brow of the hill.

As you can probably guess, I took lots of photos, and you can see them below.

I was really surprised by the number of Scottish things in the parade. Highland dancing, kilts, bagpipes, Reel Bands, Drummers, Pipe Bands!!! The whole show was really good though. It lasted over four and a half hours, and I was there for the whole thing. Luckily it wasn't too warm this morning, in fact it was quite overcast, and a couple of times I thought it was going to start raining, but luckily it didn't.

Tomorrow is the start of the Stampede, and I am going to be there all day. Will post back to let you know how I got on.
