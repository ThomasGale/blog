Today me and Lynn headed up to Edmonton to check out the West Edmonton Mall. The mall itself was absolutely massive!! I haven't been to anything like it in the UK, it quite simply has everything!! Shops (probably 2-3 of each kind), Ice Skating, Swimming Pool, Roller-Coasters, Food Stalls, Sea Lion shows, everything. You can check out some pictures of the trip below:

However, what was the best thing about the trip?

That's right, the hire car!!! No idea how or why, but the second hire car that we got was a Mustang!! It was an absolutely amazing car!! You can see some pictures of it below:
