After meeting up with the people from my work at Atlas for lunch, me and Lynn headed to the Calgary Tower. I had wanted to take Lynn for a meal at the top in the revolving restaurant, however, it was going through some renovation while she was here. You can check out the pictures from the top of the tower below:

Please don't ask about the picture of and the beaver, I honestly have got no idea what I was thinking!!

After the Calgary Tower we headed to the Stampede Casino. Had a really good time playing on the Black Jack table and the slot machines. The cocktails in there are really good!! Didn't have quite as much luck as I did the last time I was there, but still had a good time!!
