We went along to the Peterhead Panto last night with it's production of Snow White and the 7 Normal Sized people Brainy, Fussy, Forgetful, Wabbit, Bossy, Lanky and Gypit.

 

I thought the show was actually quite funny, there were several parts that had me laughing. Especially the Night Vision Goggles and the Dame, who I thought was very funny.

 

It is on all this week, so if you get a chance, I would head along.
