This blog post is one of a series of blogs on Visual Studio Addins that I use.  To go back to the series index page, click [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=146).

If you use few Visual Studio Addin’s, this should definitely be one of them:

To get straight to the point, not mention people “like” commenting their code, but everyone knows that it should be done.  Using a few basics of the English language, this little addin can take something like the following:

[code lang="csharp" collapse="true" toolbar="true"]
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
  public bool IsEnabled { get; set; }

  public Form1()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
  }
}
[/code]

And turn it into the following:

[code lang="csharp" collapse="true" toolbar="true"]
/// <summary>
/// 
/// </summary>
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether this instance is enabled.
  /// </summary>
  /// <value>
  ///     <c>true</c> if this instance is enabled; otherwise, <c>false</c>.
  /// </value>
  public bool IsEnabled { get; set; }

  /// <summary>
  /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="Form1"/> class.
  /// </summary>
  public Form1()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
  }
}
[/code]

I have noted that it works very well at pulling through comments on base types which you are inheriting from.
