I was introduced to the following utility by a colleague at work:

 

[www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/](http://www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/)

 

It is a very useful utility, that is very unobtrusive, and I can see me using it on a daily basis.

 

It basically takes over when you press the “Print Screen” key on your keyboard, and allows you to perform additional activities, such as:

 

  
  * crop only a selected rectangle 
   
  * crop only a selected area by drawing a “lasso” around the desired area 
   
  * draw lines onto the selected area, i.e. an arrow, or some text 
   
  * drag the highlighted area into other applications, such as Skype, MSN etc 
   
  * open the image directly in your default image application 
   
  * direct the image directly to an email or your clipboard
 

Overall, it is very, very clever!!! And I highly recommend it.
