So I have booked tickets to go and see the Calgary Stampede!! Really looking forward to it, I have heard lots of good things about it.

 

The Stampede starts on Friday 4th July with a parade, which you can see details about [here](http://parade.calgarystampede.com/). Then every day there is a [Rodeo](http://cs.calgarystampede.com/events/rodeo/) and then a [Grandstand](http://cs.calgarystampede.com/events/grandstand-show.html) show. I am planning on going to both of these events on the Saturday, so hopefully it will be a nice day, so I can get lots of photos!!

 

From what I understand there are lots of rides and things to do while in the Stampede ground, so don't think I will be bored.

 

Will let you know how I get on!!
