Although not strictly an Addin for Visual Studio, this is a very useful application none the less. You can find it here:

Before installing, make sure that you have PowerShell installed, and while installing, select a custom install. This gives you the option of adding the “Windows Shell Extension”, which applies a TortoiseSVN style overlay to the files on your file system which you have exported from TFS, indicating their current check out status.
