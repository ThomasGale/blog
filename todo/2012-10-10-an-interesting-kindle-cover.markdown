_DISCLAIMER:_ I was recently approached by [GearZap.com](http://www.gearzap.com/) to do an unbiased review of one of the products from their site.  The following is the result of that review.

Like most developers I know, I have a Kindle.  The ability to carry hundreds of books around with you is a great thing, and a great resource.  Gone are the days of lugging around one epic tomb of a development book, we now carry them all.  However, in order to ensure that your Kindle doesn’t get damaged, you really need to get a cover for it, and if you haven’t already got one, make sure to take a look at the great selection [here](http://www.gearzap.com/amazon-kindle-accessories/amazon-kindle-covers.html).

I was asked to do a review of the [Tuff-Luv Embrace Amazon Kindle Cover](http://www.gearzap.com/tuff-luv-embrace-amazon-kindle-cover-black.html), and I am happy to say that this is a really nice cover.  The unique selling point for this cover is the integrated hand-band, which makes is very easy to hold the Kindle.  The hand-band is really aimed at using your left hand, however, I found that it will also work with your right hand, although I have to say that it didn’t feel as secure when doing it this way.  While using the hand-band, you are easily able to reach the page navigation controls on your Kindle.

When the Kindle is seated within the cover is feels very secure, and I don’t think that I would ever be concerned that it was going to become dislodged.  All round, a nice cover, that I would happy recommend to anyone.

Some photos of the Kindle contained within this cover are shown below:
