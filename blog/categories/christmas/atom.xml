    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the run up to Christmas I keep getting asked the same question…</p>

<p>What do you want for Christmas?</p>

<p>The typical answer that I give to this question is, “I don’t know, just get me vouchers”. I normally say Amazon vouchers, that way, when something does crop up that I quite fancy, nine times of out ten, Amazon, or an Amazon reseller will have it, and I just order it up.</p>

<p>There are a couple things that I have been thinking about purchasing lately, and some vouchers towards them would help out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001V7RF9U&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a>The first is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U">LEGO Mindstorms.</a> I have always been a big fan of LEGO, and I had a ton of LEGO Technic and LEGO Pirates when I was growing up, but there is something very appealing about the ability to control the “thing” that you create using the 32-bit microprocessor that comes with it. I have thought about getting this for a long time now, but never have, so I am thinking that this Christmas could be as good a time as any.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B004FRZ4E6&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004FRZ4E6" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second thing that I am thinking about is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6">Netduino</a> board. I have absolutely no idea what I would actually create if I were to get one of these, but again, I just love the idea of being able to control “stuff” via the programs that I create. If I do end of getting one of these, I guess I should pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449302459/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1449302459">Getting Started</a> book that goes along with it, that may I am less likely to blow things up!</p>

<p>What other geek related things are out there that could be a good shout for folks to get me for Christmas, or for me to buy for myself? I guess I am looking for something hardware related, not software.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
