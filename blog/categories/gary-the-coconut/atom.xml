    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to the fact that our business Headquarters are in Canada, there are a fair number of Canadians in our Scottish Office. One Friday evening, the Canadians decided that they were going to have a night of Nintendo Wii fun round at the company flat, and I was invited to come along. Initially, I thought that this would be a great idea, so I said that I would come along. However, later that night, my plans changed, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to come along, so I text them to let them know that I wouldn&rsquo;t be attending.</p>

<p>The following Monday, I was told that I had missed a really good night, and as the stories of the evening were recited, I realised that I probably should have attended. Days passed, and I thought that was the end of it, however, I was wrong&hellip;..</p>

<p>Turns out, that rather than be without a Gary at the party, the Canadians thought it would be a good idea to replace a Scottish Gary with someone else, and so <strong>Gary The Coconut</strong> was born.</p>

<p>Since that night, Gary The Coconut has ventured out into the world, in lots of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He has got his own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Gary_Park/1155266863">Facebook account</a></p></li>
<li><p>He has been Skiing</p></li>
<li><p>He has been White Water Rafting</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to a BBQ</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to lots of parties</p></li>
</ul>


<p>He has made lots of friends along the way, however, his best friend in the whole wide world has to be Wes:</p>

<p>Where will Gary The Coconut go next? No one knows&hellip;.</p>
