<p>On Thursday 28th March 2013, I presented a talk at the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group entitled &ldquo;Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!&rdquo;.  If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing the demonstrations that were used in the presentation, or the slide desk, you can find this information below.  If you did attend, let me say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!</p>

Does all this information take a toll on your psyche or sharpen the saw? Is it a matter of finding the right tools and filters to capture what you need, or do you just need to unplug.

<h1>thanks</h1>

<p>There are too many people to thank for helping to get this tour under way that I won’t be able to list them all here, but hopefully you know who you all are, and I very much appreciate all your help!!</p>

<h1>How did all this start?</h1>

<p>A few of you might be wondering how this event got started, and I thought I should take the time to explain.  First up, a HUGE shout has to go out to Gregor Suttie (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gsuttie">@gsuttie</a>), if it were not for him, this tour would not be happening.  Let me explain…</p>

<p>Through the wonders of Twitter, I was having a conversation with Gregor, and he happened to make a throw-away comment along the lines of “…wouldn’t it be great if <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman">@shanselman</a> came to Scotland!”.  I quickly replied to him saying that yes, this would be great, but really, what are the chances.  Within a few minutes, Scott actually replied to Gregor’s tweet, asking what we were talking about.  We explained, and Scott then offered to talk the conversation offline, and provided me with his email address.  After a few emails it was clear that Scott was very interested in visiting Scotland as he has been able to trace his family tree back to Scotland, and we were only to happy to host him at our User Groups.  With some help from the <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developer</a> guys, plans were quickly put into place to host Scott at the four venues listed above.  Thanks again Gregor!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>Hopefully see you all there!</p>

    <updated>2012-01-10T20:58:22+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/matt-lacey-on-tour-wpug-mrlacey</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in October of 2011, I dropped an email to Matt Lacey, of the <a href="http://wpug.net/">Windows Phone User Group</a>, asking whether he would be interested in doing a talk up in Scotland at the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.  This was a bit of a long shot, but I was always brought up with the saying, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”, so I thought the worst that he could say would be “No”.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to say that Matt agreed that coming up to Aberdeen would certainly be a possibility, and in fact, he would be interested in doing a tour of the user groups up in Scotland.  Once again, with the help of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx">Scottish Meetup Network</a>, I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Matt to do 3 User Group Sessions.</p>

<p>The schedule for the tour breaks down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tuesday 21 February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edinburgh.bcs.org/events/2011-12/120221.htm">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - BCS Edinburgh and Scottish Developers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wednesday 22nd February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dwsmattlacey.eventbrite.com/">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - Dundee Web Standards</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Thursday 23rd February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adnuguk-feb2012.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn">Getting started with Windows Phone – Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a very busy schedule, and hopefully you will be able to catch Matt at one of the above events.  I will update the above with links to full details of all the above events as and when they become available.</p>

<p>If you require any additional information about the above tour, please feel free to get in touch.</p>
