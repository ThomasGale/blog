So, after weeks of waiting, the Nodo update has finally landed on my HTC HD7.

I didnâ€™t get any notification on my phone, but after a day of reading tweets from people I knew were on O2 who had the update, I decided to plug my phone into computer and let the Zune software check for an update, and this is what I was greeted with:

Clicking the UPDATE button took me through to here:

I missed some steps as they happened so quickly:

This step took quite a while:
