# A Piece of Cake
## C# powered cross platform build automation

In the same way that DDD Scotland made a welcome return this year, the same was true of [DDD Reading](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/).  A .Net Community event which is hosted in the Microsoft Offices in Thames Valley Park.  I have attended this event before, in fact, it was actually one of the first .Net Community events that I went to, and this year I was asked along to present my talk on Cake.
