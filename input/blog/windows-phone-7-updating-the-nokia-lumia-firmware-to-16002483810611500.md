I woke up this morning to find that my shiny new Windows Phone 7, the Nokia Lumia 800, was telling me that I had a new update.

As some of you will know, I REALLY like the Nokia Lumia 800, it is a great piece of hardware, but it has one killer feature missing, in my opinion.  This is the ability to tether the phone to my laptop using “Internet Sharing” as I could on my HTC HD7.

I have heard from both parties in this problem, i.e. Nokia and my mobile phone provider, and both say that it “should” work, but alas, it doesn’t.  I was sort of hoping that this new update would bring with it the ability to tether, but alas, it didn’t ![Sad smile](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png).

In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here is the screen shot that greets you when you start to do this update:

This update took my Windows Phone 7 from:

Firmware Revision Number: **1600.2479.7740.11451 **to **1600.2483.8106.11500**
