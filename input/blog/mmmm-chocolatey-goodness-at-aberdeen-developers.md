# My Chocolatey Talk at Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group

On Thursday 28th March 2013, I presented a talk at the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group entitled "Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!".  If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing the demonstrations that were used in the presentation, or the slide desk, you can find this information below. If you did attend, let me say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!

# The Code

As explained on the night, there was very little "code" used within this presentation, but rather it was a demonstration of how Chocolatey can used to install, update, and uninstall packages on your computer.  If you are interested in the demonstrations that were shown on the night, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/gep13/ChocolateyDemos/wiki).
