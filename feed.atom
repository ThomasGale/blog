		<title>Granny's Poem</title>
		<updated>2017-02-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="the-broken-chain"&gt;The Broken Chain&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today at my Granny's funeral, the following poem was read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We little knew that morning&lt;br&gt;
That God was going to call your name.&lt;br&gt;
In life  we loved you dearly.&lt;br&gt;
In death we do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It broke our hearts to lose you&lt;br&gt;
You did not go alone,&lt;br&gt;
For part of us went with you&lt;br&gt;
The day God called you home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You left us peaceful memories&lt;br&gt;
Your love is still our guide,&lt;br&gt;
And though we cannot see you&lt;br&gt;
You are always by our side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family chain is broken,&lt;br&gt;
And nothing seems the same,&lt;br&gt;
But as God calls us one by one&lt;br&gt;
The chain will link again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found hand written on the back of a card, in my Granny's handwriting.  It is a lovely poem, and one that seemed exactly right for her service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not sure exactly why my Granny had chosen to copy down the poem onto the card, but there must have been a reason.  A bit of research turned up the &lt;a href="http://www.rontranmer.com/broken-chain-revised"&gt;following website&lt;/a&gt;, which credits the poem (in a revised form) to Ron Trammer.  Thank you for your lovely words.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;h1 id="amelia-mabel-park"&gt;Amelia Mabel Park&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn and I are very proud to announce the arrival of our second daughter Amelia Mabel Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/02/17/amelia-mabel-park.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Amelia Mabel Park"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was born at 02:02 at the Aberdeen Maternity Ward. She weighed 7 pounds, 8 and 1/2 ounces.  Both Mum and Baby are doing very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like her &lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/alivia-anne-park"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt;, Amelia has a very special birthday, in the sense that it is symmetrical, 17/2/17, where Alivia's birthday is 13/9/13.  There is something magical to me in how this has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very much looking forward to bringing my amazing wife and new daughter home from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to rebase a PR branch</title>
		<updated>2017-01-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="why-on-earth-would-you-do-this"&gt;Why on earth would you do this?!?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September 2016, GitHub announced a very interesting feature, namely, the ability for a maintainer of a repository to push changes back to a remote repository (i.e. fork) from where a PR had been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more information about this &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/2247-improving-collaboration-with-forks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly interesting for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, during a PR review, the code that is being submitted might be almost exactly correct, and ready for inclusion in the repository, and there is only one tiny thing not quite right.  You, as the maintainer, could spend some time explaining what is required, or, with this new feature you can simply make the change yourself, push it back to the source branch, and then accept the PR.  Using this approach has a number of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the changes associated with the PR are contained within the PR for later review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any Continuous Integration checks performed on the PR can be run again with these changes in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is sometimes quicker to simply make the change, rather than trying to explain it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the very nature of Open Source contributions means that there might be some time between when the PR was submitted, and when it is reviewed and ultimately merged.  On the projects that I work on, when this happens, there is a preference to have the changes in the PR branch rebased with the upstream branch, therefore bringing it up to date.  However, asking a contributor to an open source project to rebase a branch can sometimes be quite daunting.  I remember the first time that I was &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238"&gt;asked to do this&lt;/a&gt; on a PR into the Chocolatey Repository, and I literally had NO clue what I was doing.  Thankfully I had a lot of guidance from &lt;a href="https://github.com/rismoney"&gt;rismoney&lt;/a&gt; to help with this.  But again, rebasing can be quite daunting.  Being able to do this on behalf of the contributor opens up the potentially for a much quicker turn around on merging a PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Performing a rebase on someone else's fork is really only something that should be done if you intend to merge the PR straight away, once any CI builds have passed.  Doing anything else would leave their branch in a state that differs from their local copy of the truth, and quite simply, it would be bad form to leave it in this state, so don't do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-contributor-has-to-allow-the-branch-to-be-updated"&gt;The contributor has to allow the branch to be updated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the linked article, allow a PR branch to be updated is something that the contributor can choose not to allow, but it is enabled by default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/29/allow-edit-from-maintainers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Allow Edits from Maintainers"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage any contributor to leave this checkbox ticked when submitting a PR, as it does open up much more flexibility on the part of the maintainers of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lets-see-this-in-action"&gt;Let's see this in action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of where this can be used, let's use this &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake/pull/1360"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;.  Having reviewed the changes in this PR, I can say that it is good to go, however, this is the current state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/29/this-branch-is-out-of-date-with-the-base-branch.png" class="img-fluid" alt="This branch is out of date with the base branch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the CI builds associated with the PR have passed, but it is now out of date with the base branch, meaning that it needs to be rebased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the above screen shot, you will see the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add more commits by pushing to the wixheat-pog-fix branch on jnm2/cake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells the maintainer of the project that when this PR was created, the box was checked to allow changes from the maintainer.  So, let's go ahead and rebase the PR branch with the latest from upstream, and push the changes back.  Then, once all the CI builds pass, we can get the PR merged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the steps that I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir jnm2
cd jnm2
git clone https://github.com/jnm2/cake.git
cd cake
git checkout wixheat-pog-fix
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cake-build/cake.git
git fetch upstream develop
git rebase upstream/develop
git push -f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this last step causes the following to happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/29/git-push-force.png" class="img-fluid" alt="git push force"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e. all the CI builds for this PR are triggered again, but this time, the branch is up to date with the base branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all you have to do is wait for these builds to finish, and assuming everything went well, you will see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/29/all-ready-to-be-merged.png" class="img-fluid" alt="All ready to be merged"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point, you can merge the PR.  Job done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, almost...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things in Open Source is to be kind and courteous.  Someone has went out of their way to make a contribution into your project, so make sure that you say thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/29/say-thank-you.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Say thank you"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="thanks-to-mattias"&gt;Thanks to Mattias&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks have to go to Mattias (a.k.a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devlead"&gt;devlead&lt;/a&gt;) for showing me that this was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Use Octokit to create labels</title>
		<updated>2017-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="why-would-you-need-to-do-this"&gt;Why would you need to do this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question!  I have a small amount compulsive behaviour when it comes to labels that are associated with GitHub projects that I work on.  Both in terms of the colour that is used, as well as the text that is associated with the label.  Being consistent means that it is much easier to identity what an issue/pull request is about, before even reading anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="so-what-is-the-problem"&gt;So what is the problem?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, when you create a new repository on GitHub, this is what you get for labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/27/default-github-labels.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Default GitHub Labels"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while some of you might be saying there is nothing wrong with this, I much prefer them to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/27/my-github-labels.png" class="img-fluid" alt="My GitHub Labels"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, much better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I could make these changes manually through the GitHub User Interface, this is time consuming, and prone to mistakes.  Having done this more than two times, it was time to automate it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="enter-octokit"&gt;Enter Octokit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octokit is GitHub API Client, which means that you can do pretty much anything through it, that you can do through the GitHub User Interface, including the creation of labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a small amount of hacking, this is what I came up with (&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn't really consider this production ready code, but it does serve my purpose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="run-the-program"&gt;Run the Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;private static GitHubClient _githubClient;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    _githubClient = CreateGitHubClient();

    GetLabels();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-the-github-client"&gt;Create the GitHub Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This part requires you to input either the password or access token that you use for GitHub.  The ProductHeaderValue can really be anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;private static GitHubClient CreateGitHubClient()
{
    var credentials = new Credentials("gep13", "&amp;lt;your access token needs to go here&amp;gt;");
    var github = new GitHubClient(new ProductHeaderValue("gep13")) { Credentials = credentials };
    return github;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setup-default-labels"&gt;Setup Default Labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;private static List&amp;lt;NewLabel&amp;gt; _defaultLabels = new List&amp;lt;NewLabel&amp;gt;();

private static void SetUpDefaultLabels()
{
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Breaking change", "b60205"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Bug", "ee0701"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Build", "009800"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Documentation", "d4c5f9"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Feature", "84b6eb"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Improvement", "207de5"));
    _defaultLabels.Add(new NewLabel("Up-for-grabs", "159818"));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-and-delete-labels"&gt;Create and Delete Labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;private static void CreateLabels()
{
    SetUpDefaultLabels();

    try
    {
        var labels = _githubClient.Issue.Labels.GetAllForRepository("cake-contrib", "Cake.Ember").Result;

        foreach (var label in labels)
        {
            _githubClient.Issue.Labels.Delete("cake-contrib", "Cake.Ember", label.Name).Wait();
        }

        foreach (var label in _defaultLabels)
        {
            _githubClient.Issue.Labels.Create("cake-contrib", "Cake.Ember", label).Wait();
        }
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        Debug.Write("boom");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="so-what-are-you-doing-here"&gt;So what are you doing here?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially what this boils down to is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub Client, which gives you access to the GitHub API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the default labels that I want to create&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop through and delete all the existing labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop through and create the new default labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in place, the total execution takes around 3 seconds to complete, as opposed to minutes of clicking the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to create gh-pages branch</title>
		<updated>2017-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="let-the-branching-commence"&gt;Let the branching commence!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third time that I have had to look this up, and tailor to my needs, so it's time to write it down, so that I don't forget again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aid of &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;, I am now generating documentation for some of the projects that I work on.  This is done by generating the documentation, and then pushing the result into a &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch on the GitHub Repository where the source code is hosted.  This process is actually really simple, and it will be the topic of another blog post, but in order for it to work, we first need to create the gh-pages branch in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work, we need to create an &lt;code&gt;orphan&lt;/code&gt; branch.  More details on what this is, and why we need it, can be found &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-using-the-command-line/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, everything that you need to complete this process is in that article, it just isnt' specific to my needs.  So this is what I need...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
echo "My Page" &amp;gt; index.html
git add index.html
git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of that worked, you should now have something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/27/first-gh-pages-branch.png" class="img-fluid" alt="First gh-pages branch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, a new gh-pages branch, created on a repository is going to be accessible via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e here: &lt;a href="https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Ember/"&gt;https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Ember/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be configured in the Settings for your repository:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can configure a custom domain name for accessing the website that is hosted on GitHub.  For my purposes though, the default settings and configuration are all that I need.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Adding clickable links for headers</title>
		<updated>2017-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="click-click-click"&gt;Click, click, click!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltapestry.net/posts/markdig-cheat-sheet"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://github.com/wekempf"&gt;William Kempf&lt;/a&gt;, specifically this &lt;a href="http://www.digitaltapestry.net/posts/markdig-cheat-sheet#auto-identifiers"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;, it got me thinking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's great that Markdig is automatically creating those anchor points in the HTML that is rendered, however, they are not exactly discoverable.  If you look at what happens on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki"&gt;GitHub wiki&lt;/a&gt; that renders Markdown, you will see that it comes up with this really nice icon on hovering over the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/11/github-wiki-rendering.png" class="img-fluid" alt="How headers are rendered on GitHub"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on this icon navigates directly to the header, and makes it really easy to share that link with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="i-want-to-do-this-do"&gt;I want to do this do!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write a blog post, I typically break the post into a number of sections, and I wanted to be able to do the same thing here.  So, I asked the question in the &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/Wyamio/Wyam?at=587544c9873d96e16d4f9b05"&gt;Wyam Gitter Room&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately I got a response from &lt;a href="https://github.com/daveaglick"&gt;Dave Glick&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is - in fact strongly considering adding this and code block copy buttons to the themes (it's all frontend JS stuff) - here's the two libraries I like the best: &lt;a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs"&gt;https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs&lt;/a&gt; (for anchor links) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js"&gt;https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js&lt;/a&gt; (for clipboard copying)
Adding them to your own site would just be a matter of putting the appropriate JS in the _Scripts.cshtml file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-implementation"&gt;The implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information in hand, I set about adding it to my blog.  The only addition that was required was the following in my &lt;code&gt;input\_scripts.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-html"&gt;&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/anchor.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    anchors.options.placement = 'left';
    anchors.add();
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-info"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to match what GitHub does, I have explicitly set the &lt;code&gt;placement&lt;/code&gt; property to appear on the left of the header.  The default is to have it appear on the right of the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of this &lt;del&gt;hard work&lt;/del&gt; can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/11/anchorjs-in-action.png" class="img-fluid" alt="AnchorJs in action"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an easily discoverable way to link to section headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-future"&gt;The future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like Dave is planning on adding this functionality to the default Blog Recipe for Wyam, so at some point it is likely that you will not need to do the above, it should just happen auto-magically, but for now, I am more than happy with the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to skip AppVeyor builds</title>
		<updated>2017-01-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="why-skip-builds"&gt;Why skip builds?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 times out of 10, there is actually no need to skip a build that is triggered on AppVeyor, or any Continuous Integration server.  The whole point is that you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to trigger a build on every commit, so that you can see when things stopped working.  There are however those times when the change that you are making doesn't justify, or require a build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is normally when I am making a small change, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correcting whitespace in a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding/correcting documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixing a coding/style convention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, running a build simply isn't needed, as it is highly unlikely that these changes will result in a failed build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, purists out there will be saying that your Continuous Integration builds shouldn't take a long to run, therefore, you should simply run every build.  While I don't disagree that your Continuous Integration builds should be quick to run, I still think there is a need to control if/when a build executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="why-not-simply-stop-the-build"&gt;Why not simply stop the build?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people out there might be asking why not simply stop the build if not required.  There is nothing wrong with that approach, but for me, it would break me out of the coding workflow.  I would need to jump to the Continuous Integration server in order to stop the build, taking me away from what I was doing.  This for me is a show stopper, so there has to be another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="appveyor-has-you-covered"&gt;AppVeyor has you covered!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Open Source Projects that I work on, I use &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/"&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt; as my default Continuous Integration system.  It is incredibly easy to setup and use, and it is completely free for Open Source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have configured AppVeyor to work with your source control repository, any time you create a commit into the repository, a build will be triggered on AppVeyor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="alert alert-info"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your AppVeyor configuration, this might not be exactly correct.  For example, you might have corrected AppVeyor to only trigger on certain branches.  However, for the purposes of this blog post, let's assume that the above it correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, a series of commits into your repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-github-commits.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Series of commits into Source Control"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;results in the following builds being triggered on AppVeyor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-builds.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resulting Builds on AppVeyor"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="skip-commits-using-direct-commits-messages"&gt;Skip commits using direct commits messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's imaginge the situation that I was away to make a commit into source control, if I add either &lt;code&gt;[skip ci]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[ci skip]&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the commit message, then AppVeyor will ignore the commit, and &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; run a build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show this, have a look at this series of commits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-github-commits-with-skip.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Series of commits into Source Control with skip commit message"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the resulting builds on AppVeyor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-appveyor-builds-with-skip.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resulting Builds on AppVeyor with skip commit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that there was not a build for the commit message of &lt;code&gt;Fourth commit [skip ci]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-good-but-not-quite-good-enough"&gt;It's good, but not quite good enough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above strategy works really well, however, it does rely on the end user, i.e. me, remembering to add the nomenclature at the end of the commit message.  Unfortunately, this is not something that is likely to happen, and would therefore invalidate the premise of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help with this, AppVeyor also helps by allowing the configuration of a regular expression, which examines the commit message, and based on finding a match, will skip the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is ideal for the way that I work.  I use commit messages like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(GH-123) Added foo to bar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the GitHub issue associated with the commit is housed within a set of parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do a commit that is purely related to say documentation, then I use a commit message similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(doc) Corrected typo in bar class&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can configure a regular expression that can match on this convention, then I can use my existing workflow, whilst also skipping builds that are not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AppVeyor configurtion that I use to make this happen is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;#---------------------------------#
#  Skip builds for doc changes    #
#---------------------------------#
skip_commits:
  # Regex for matching commit message
  message: /\(doc\).*/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I have a commit into source control like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-github-commits-with-doc.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Series of commits into Source Control with doc commit message"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then AppVeyor simply skips the build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/10/appveyor-builds-with-doc.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resulting Builds on AppVeyor with doc commit message"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="additional-options"&gt;Additional options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above configuration works perfectly for me, however, AppVeyor includes a number of other &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/filtering-commits/"&gt;configuration options&lt;/a&gt; to skip builds.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skipping and including commits based on author of commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skipping and including commits based on file name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally haven't had a need for this type of configuration, but I would encourage you to look at them, if they suit your particular workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2016 - A Retrospective</title>
		<updated>2017-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="what-a-year-it-has-been"&gt;What a year it has been!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on 2016 it has been full of personal high and lows, but all in all, it has been a great year, for lots of reasons.  This post is a very brief recap, in no particular order, of some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="baby-park-2"&gt;Baby Park #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in 2016, Lynn and I were very happy to announce the impedding arrival of our second child.  Baby Park #2 is due on February 16th.  Yes, that is only just over 6 weeks away!  We are trying to tell ourselves that we are ready for the arrival, but I am not sure if we are.  The last couple of days have been about getting things ready, making the cot, the moses basket, etc, but still loads to do.  Alivia is getting more and more excited about being a big sister, which is great to see, so definitely some fun times ahead here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-contributions"&gt;GitHub Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking part in &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://24pullrequests.com/"&gt;24 Pull Requests&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, I had a renewed vigour for contributing to the Open Source Community, and this continued through the whole of 2016.  Which can be seen in the chart below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/GitHub-Contributions.png" class="img-fluid" alt="2016 GitHub Contributions"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The eagle eyed amongst you might notice a prolonged break at the end of June.  That was when I was on holiday in Portugal for my sister's wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think I do have a sort of addiction, but it has been great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have continued to contribute to the projects that I have a passion for, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseManager"&gt;GitReleaseManager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion"&gt;GitVersion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as helping out on other projects, where and when I can.  I can honestly say that I have learnt a lot through the contributions that I have been making, and I am looking forward to continuing the contributions through into this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick recap of the years events from a Cake perspective can be seen &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/12/icing-on-the-cake"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="podcasts"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I was lucky enough to be invited onto a number of podcasts to discuss &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, the C# Build Automation system which I am a maintainer of.  These were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-on-msdev-show"&gt;MS Dev Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-on-.net-rocks"&gt;.Net Rocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-on-cynical-developer"&gt;Cynical Developer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-on-herding-code"&gt;Herding Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a long time listener to all of these shows (with the exception of Cynical Developer which has really only just started, but is now on my playlist), and to get invited to talk on them was a huge privelege.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly necessary and excited about going on the .Net Rocks show, due to the fact that it was an in person interview with Carl and Richard while I was at &lt;a href="http://ndcoslo.com/"&gt;NDC Oslo&lt;/a&gt;.  I had also just came off stage from doing my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of speaking engagements, this year was by far by busiest.  With the arrival of our daughter Alivia a few years ago, I sort of stepped back from submitting talks to Developer Conferences, but this year that changed...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did talks at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-at-aberdeen-developers"&gt;Aberdeen Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-at-ddd-scotland"&gt;DDD Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-at-ndc-oslo"&gt;NDC Oslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-at-ddd-reading"&gt;DDD Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-at-ddd-north"&gt;DDD North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stand out of the above has to be NDC Oslo.  This is quite simply an amazing conference and I have been lucky enough to attend it for the last 3 years.  It was also the most nerve wracking one, as it was the largest audience that I have ever presented to.  Happy to say that I made it through, and the feedback that I received was remarkably positive, so I am very happy with how the talks went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to all the Conference Organisers for these events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hacktoberfest-and-24-pull-requests"&gt;Hacktoberfest and 24 Pull Requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way as I did in 2015, I participated in both &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://24pullrequests.com/"&gt;24 Pull Reuqests&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don't know, Hacktoberfest is an online event ran by &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is simple, in the month of October, submit 4 or more Pull Requests to a project on GitHub.  Simples!  If you do this, you get an awesome t-shirt, as well as some swag, and of course, some bragging rights and internet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/hacktoberfest-swag.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 Pull Requests is similar, with the exception being that the target is 24 Pull Requests, and it is in the month of December.  Unfortunately, there isn't any swag associated with this particular contest, but I wouldn't let that put you off taking part.  This year, I was a little bit late in getting all my Pull Requests in, working right up until the last day.  In 2015, I was able to make 40 Pull Requests and complete in plenty of time.  Going to have to pull my socks up in 2017!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-overflow-contributions"&gt;Stack Overflow Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been an on/off user of Stack Overflow since joining in 2011.  Mainly as a consumer of answers, it is an invaluable resource.  In 2016 though, I made a concerted effort to try to provide answers to questions rather than simply use the existing answers.  This was mainly due to my increased involvement in the Open Source projects that I work on.  As a result, I have seen an significant increase in my Stack Overflow reputation this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/stackoverflow-reputation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Reputation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And having just logged in just now, I have just seen that I am now in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/stackoverflow-reputation-top.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Reputation Top 14% overall"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, my top answer on Stack Overflow is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28235388/where-is-the-chocolatey-installation-path/28239451#28239451"&gt;Where is the Chocolatey installation path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and my top question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30024353/how-to-use-visual-studio-code-as-default-editor-for-git"&gt;How to use Visual Studio Code as Default Editor for Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have been using Stack Overflow more and more, I have started to see some of the issues that I have heard people talking about on places like Twitter.  i.e. people getting into arguments, questions getting quickly marked down, and deleted/removed, etc.  There is definitely an element of this, but I still think that the benefits far outweigh the negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still annoying though when you spend &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41294279/chocolatey-from-where-does-it-find-the-package"&gt;a lot of time on an answer&lt;/a&gt; and then you get &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; back from the original author!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, you can get access to some funny hats!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/stackoverflow-profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Profile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="teamcity-plugin-contest"&gt;TeamCity Plugin Contest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I was asked to be a judge in the annual &lt;a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/10/teamcity-2016-plugin-contest-announcement/"&gt;TeamCity Plugin Contest&lt;/a&gt;, which was indeed an honour and a privelege.  The contest website can be seen &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/contest/teamcity/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the TeamCity Development Team, Wesley Higbee, Jeffrey Palermo and myself were asked to judge 26 different plugins, scoring them on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usefulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creativity and Elegance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code quality and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/teamcity-plugin-contest.png" class="img-fluid" alt="TeamCity Coding Contest Judges"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't able to offer much in terms of judging Code Quality, as I have never done any Kotlin programming (although it is on my list of things to look at), but I was able to score the plugins in the other areas.  In all honesty, this was a lot of fun (although it did take quite a while to go through them all).  There were some amazing entries, and the end results can be seen &lt;a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/12/teamcity-plugin-contest-2016-winners-announcement/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Congratulations to the winners, and well done to everyone who took part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="winops-conf-2016"&gt;WinOps Conf 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May I was able to attend the WinOps Conference in London.  This is the second time that I have attended this conference, but this time I was there in a more official capacity.  &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; was the lanyard sponsor for the event, and I was there to answer any questions that anyone had on Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/chocolatey-lanyard-sponsor.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Lanyard Sponsor"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to hang out on the Puppet booth, and to hand out some of the new Chocolatey Icon stickers which were released this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to grab some time with Jeffrey Snover to discuss some of the newer features that have been coming out recently in Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/winops-chocolatey-jsnover.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps 2016 Chocolatey Jeffrey Snover"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Image taken from Official WinOps Twitter Feed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/winopsldn/status/735135079886950400"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from this event can be seen on Channel 9 &lt;a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WinOps/WinOps-Conf-2016"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="microsoft-band-saga"&gt;Microsoft Band Saga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who follows me on Twitter will be aware that I have had a number of ongoing problems with my Microsoft Band 2.  I genuinely, really like this device, it does everything that I need, and more, however, it keeps breaking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/microsoft-band.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Microsoft Band strap split"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I have had to return the device twice for the same problem, in the exact same location.  In December, the same thing happened again.  This time around though, after hearing that there are &lt;a href="https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/microsoft-band/82073/disbanded-microsoft-confirms-will-not-sell-band-3"&gt;no plans for Microsoft to continue with the device&lt;/a&gt;,  I have requested a refund from Microsoft, rather than a replacement.  I haven't yet heard whether this is going to go through or not, but I am hopeful.  A courier is picking up the device on the 4th January, so I should find out soon whether it will go through.  The next question is obviously what to replace it with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that Microsoft have indeed refunded me for the Microsoft Band.  Now I just need to decide on what device to go with next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aberdeen-developers"&gt;Aberdeen Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have taken a step backwards recently, through the help of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyami"&gt;@nyami&lt;/a&gt;, I am very happy to say that &lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/"&gt;Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group&lt;/a&gt; is still going strong.  I was able to help out this year with a couple of the events, but lots of credit has to go to Doug for keeping it going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the group hosted 8 events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/october-2016-meeting-keith-davidson/"&gt;Keith Davidson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/september-2016-meeting-colin-mackay/"&gt;Colin Mackay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/august-2016-meeting-steven-chalmers/"&gt;Steven Chalmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/july-2016-meeting-mike-taulty/"&gt;Mike Taulty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/may-2016-meeting-kendall-miller/"&gt;Kendall Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/april-2016-meeting-gary-ewan-park/"&gt;Gary Ewan Park&lt;/a&gt; - who is THAT guy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/march-2016-meeting-christos-matskas/"&gt;Christos Matskas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/scotnetrocks-aberdeen/"&gt;Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stand out event is &lt;del&gt;the one that I did&lt;/del&gt; obviously the aptly named ScotNetRocks tour!  This featured the amazing Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell from the &lt;a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/"&gt;.Net Rocks podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  This event was done in conjunction with the guys from &lt;a href="https://scottishdevelopers.com/"&gt;Scottish Developers&lt;/a&gt; and saw Carl and Richard visit Glasgow, Edinburgh, as well as Aberdeen.  The tour was a fantastic success, and the feedback that we got was amazing!  Once again, a huge thanks for the sponsors of the event, &lt;a href="http://www.codify.ltd.uk/"&gt;Codify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.evokeit.com/"&gt;Evoke IT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.co.uk/uk.html"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt; without whom the event couldn't have happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/01/03/scotnetrocks.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="ScotNetRocks Tour Aberdeen"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="converted-blog-to-wyam"&gt;Converted Blog to Wyam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a very long time, this blog has suffered from a lack of updates.  The main excuse for this was that the workflow for creating a post (in my opinion) was significantly jarring, so although from time to time I had ideas for creating posts, this simply didn't happen.  This is now set to change though.  In December I converted this blog to use &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt; as the underlying blog engine, and in addition to switching to using &lt;a href="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/"&gt;Markdown Monster&lt;/a&gt;, the workflow is far smoother.  This is mainly down to the plugins that Markdown Monster comes with, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snagit Screen Capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste Code as Gist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save Image to Azure Blob Storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means that the process of creating a post, including the images associated with the post, is far more streamlined.  This will be the content of another upcoming blog post, so stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Markdown Monster has to be the out of the box for support of Chocolatey.  You can simply do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install markdownmonster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you are off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I might be a little biased here, but the fact that an application vendor is directly publishing to Chocolatey.org as a mechanism for distributing their application, is a testimony to how far Chocolatey has come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-contributions"&gt;Chocolatey Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I have in 2016 continued to contribute to the Chocolatey project.  This has included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator"&gt;package-validator&lt;/a&gt; (a tool which inspects all Chocolatey Package submissions prior to being published)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-create-packages-from-installers"&gt;Chocolatey Package Builder UI &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued work on the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=&amp;amp;moderatorQueue=true&amp;amp;prerelease=false&amp;amp;sortOrder=package-download-count"&gt;Chocolatey.org moderation queue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helping out on the Chocolatey &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco"&gt;Gitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chocolatey"&gt;Google Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answering questions on the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chocolatey"&gt;chocolatey tag on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the stand out for me this year has to be the work involved in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages"&gt;Chocolatey Core Team Packages repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you haven't heard about this, this repository is a place that houses over 100 Chocolatey Packages, almost all of which are continuously monitored for new application versions every 6 hours, which means that almost as soon as a new application version is available, an associated Chocolatey Package is created and submitted to chocolatey.org, ready for installation on your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this repository was created, it has gone through a number of iterations, and intentions, but the most recent work has cemented the intention of this repository.  Namely, it is a place that any package maintainer can contribute their package (as long as it fits in with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/wiki/Contributing-guidelines"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;) and that package can immediately take advantage of the infrastructure that has already been setup, i.e. AppVeyor Continuous Integration Builds, etc.  As a result, a community maintainer can be more effective at maintaining a package, without having to worry about the initial, rather daunting setup, that is necessary for automatic packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, with the help of some amazing people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/majkinetor"&gt;Miodrag Milić&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AdmiringWorm"&gt;Kim Nordmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/pascalberger"&gt;Pascal Berger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dtgm"&gt;dtgm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started the process of switching from using ketarin to using &lt;a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/au"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt; (which offers much better insights into what is going on with Automatic Packages), as well as pulling in more of the higher priority packages from other maintainers like &lt;a href="https://github.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;.  Pulling in these high priority packages into a central repository, which is being monitored/updated by more people, means that they are more likely to continue to be updated when there are changes to the package, which is overall, a win for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cake-contributions"&gt;Cake Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Cake has had a number of &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/12/icing-on-the-cake"&gt;success stories this year&lt;/a&gt;, but for me, the stand out one, and the one that I have been most involved in, is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib"&gt;Cake-Contrib Organisation&lt;/a&gt;.  This organisation is the sister organisation to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build"&gt;Cake-Build organisation&lt;/a&gt; and it is intended as a mechanism to ensure the longevity of the addins and modules that the Cake Community creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, open source is perilious in the sense that it relies on people's spare time to help out, and as a result, life can sometimes get in the way.  The Cake-Contrib organisation came about after a question was raised about an addin which hadn't been updated in a while, even though some PR's had been raised to correct some known issues.  In the end, this was resolved very quickly, but it did raise the question about &lt;em&gt;"what should be done if an addin/module that the Cake community relies on, stops being updated by the original creator?"&lt;/em&gt;.  This topic was discussed in length &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the upshot was this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event that an addin/module was no longer being supported, and after every effort to contact the original maintainer has been exhausted, we the Cake maintainers wanted an ability to step in to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of this was two fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/cake-contrib"&gt;cake-contrib&lt;/a&gt; user on &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/"&gt;nuget.org&lt;/a&gt; and asked package maintainers to add the cake-contrib user as a co-maintainer of their nuget packages.  This would mean that should it be required, a member of the Cake Team &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; push a new release to the same package id, without the need to create a new package id.  This is ideal, as it means that there is non duplication of packages, and therefore no ambiguity of which package is the official one.  At the time of writing this post, I am VERY happy to say that 91 of the 102 Cake addins/modules, have added the cake-contrib user as a co-maintainer.  I am personally very thankful to the Cake Community for getting behind this effort, as I really do feel that it is the best way to ensure the longevity of the packages that have been created.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, we also invited community members to add their repositories to the Cake-Contrib organisation, rather than maintain them in their own personal GitHub repos.  This is certainly NOT a requirement, just a suggestion.  The main reason to do this is again to easily allow other people to help out on a project, if/when required.  Once moved into the organisation, people can easily be added to the associated team within the repo, and start to help out on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of adding a repository to the organisation looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repo is transferred into the organisation (let's use Cake.Gem as an example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a team called Cake.Gem is created, and given admin rights to the repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original maintainer/creator of the package is added to this team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AppVeyor Role is created and project created, and team is added to role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional infracture like MyGet and NuGet is setup and configured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coveralls is set up for project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, the main thing that is brought to the table here is the setup and maintenance of the additional infrastructure that comes with an Open Source project.  By alleviating the burden, we think we can better help the Cake Community.  To date, 27 addins/modules have moved to the Cake-Contrib Organisation.  I invite anyone else who is interested to reach out to me, and we can discuss moving additional repositories under this organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thats-a-wrap"&gt;That's a wrap!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, it has been a very busy year!  Looking forward into 2017 I hope for more of the same, but with the arrival of Baby Park #2, it might not be quite as busy!&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2016-12-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="woo-hoo-over-250000-downloads"&gt;Woo hoo! Over 250000 downloads!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was invited to join the &lt;a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/cake-organisation-on-github"&gt;Cake Organisation&lt;/a&gt; back in November last year, I had a really good feeling about it all.  Both &lt;a href="https://github.com/patriksvensson"&gt;Patrik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/devlead"&gt;Mattias&lt;/a&gt; are amazing developers, and I can honestly say that I have learnt a lot from them since joining the team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks a special milestone for Cake.  Today it has now been downloaded over 250000 times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2016/12/23/250000-downloads.png" class="img-fluid" alt="250000 downloads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the screenshot, that means that it is downloaded, on average, 265 times every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really do have an amazing community on the Cake project, and we are truly thankful for all the help and support that we get in order to make Cake the build automation system that you want.  I am very much looking forward to continuing to work on the Cake project, and the next blog post where we reach 1000000 downloads!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Happy Birthday Dad</title>
		<updated>2016-11-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="best-present-ever"&gt;Best present ever!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I was surprised with an awesome present from Lynn, Alivia and Aiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2016/11/30/happy-birthday-dad.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Best Present Ever"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Daddy is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger than Superman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Braver than Captain America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smarter than Batman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quicker than The Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tougher than Wolverine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who know my wife...  Yes, she did get some help, thanks Bruce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on the heels of a few podcasts appearances, I am happy to announce that myself and Mattias were interviewed on the &lt;a href="http://herdingcode.com/"&gt;Herding Code&lt;/a&gt; talking about &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the show &lt;a href="http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-219-cake-with-gary-park-and-mattias-karlsson/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I have to give a lot of credit to the guys behind these podcasts, they really do know what they are doing, and make it very easy to talk about the topic.  Thanks for having us on!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cake talk at DDD North</title>

&lt;h2 id="c-powered-cross-platform-build-automation"&gt;C# powered cross platform build automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a run of Cake talks this year, today saw me presenting at &lt;a href="http://dddnorth.co.uk/"&gt;DDD North&lt;/a&gt;.  Today's event was very well organised, and I was priveledged to be part of it.  Thanks for inviting me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-code"&gt;The Code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in following along with the demos that I gave during this talk, you can find all the information in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/CakeDemos"&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-slides"&gt;The Slides&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in seeing the slides from the talk, you can find them displayed below, and also they are available as a download by clicking through to the slideshare site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with how this talk went on the day, but I was even happier once I got the speaker feedback.  These were the results/comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker Knowledge: 9/9
Speaker Presentation: 8.41/9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot to fit in within an hour but covered the basics well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrows back to front in build workflow? Pedantic me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring cake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fantastic, thanks Gary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great intro to cake. Thanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great talk, I will use it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really nice demo. Good explanation of motivations (why/why not use it?). Debuggable build scripts is amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well structured, clear. Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who attended, and I am very glad that you all liked it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that a podcast appearance that I did has just been published.  You can find the show &lt;a href="http://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/1/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a brand new podcast called &lt;a href="http://cynicaldeveloper.com/"&gt;Cynical Developer&lt;/a&gt; and the man behind it is &lt;a href="http://cynicaldeveloper.com/about/"&gt;James Studdart&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a great discussion about &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; and I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish James all the best with his future shows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that DDD Scotland made a welcome return this year, the same was true of &lt;a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/"&gt;DDD Reading&lt;/a&gt;.  A .Net Community event which is hosted in the Microsoft Offices in Thames Valley Park.  I have attended this event before, in fact, it was actually one of the first .Net Community events that I went to, and this year I was asked along to present my talk on Cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-code"&gt;The Code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who attended the event on the day.  I have just received the speaker feedback, and I have to say that I am very happy with the results/comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker Knowledge: 8.62/9
Speaker Presentation: 7.85/9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Tenet" is not "Tennant"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brilliant!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly not passionate enough about cake :) Great talk, good intro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good product, talk needs a little more cheese/humour but good and informative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hungry now! :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interesting - good demo nice intro to useful tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would be good to have more demo time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be taking on board some of these comments for my upcoming talk at DDD North.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;h1 id="cake-contrib-organisation-has-been-created-on-github"&gt;Cake-Contrib Organisation has been created on GitHub&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I created the Cake-Contrib on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2016/8/17/cake-contrib-organisation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Cake-Contrib Organisation on GitHub"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been created after the discussion that was had in this &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the development of addin's for Cake that can be more easily maintained by all members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features"&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; including the option to see a history of your contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cake discussion on .Net Rocks!</title>
		<updated>2016-07-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="achievement-unlocked"&gt;Achievement unlocked!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of the .Net Rocks podcast, I have been listening for longer than I can remember, and I was blown away when I was able to arrange an appearance on the show to discuss &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;.  As some of you may know, Carl and Richard have a recording booth at &lt;a href="http://ndcoslo.com/"&gt;NDC Oslo&lt;/a&gt; where they are able to record a number of shows back to back, when everyone is in the same place, and I was lucky enough to get selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-show"&gt;The show&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show has just been published, and you can find it &lt;a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1321"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  All in all, it was great fun doing the show.  Both Carl and Richard are seasoned professionals, and make it very easy to talk about the topic at hand.  I had just finished presenting my talk at NDC Oslo, so I was already buzzing, so I might come across as a little over excited, but I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-5000-question"&gt;The $5000 question&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had put a lot of thought into the question, but in the end I sort of wimped out, as I wasn't really able to think of anything.  In fairness though, everyone likes playing with toys, so it wouldn't be a complete waste of money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I was blown away by the fact that a talk I submitted to NDC Oslo was actually accepted, and today was the day that it actually happened!  To say that I was nervous would be an understatement, but I was very happy with how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you all may know, all the sessions at NDC Oslo are recorded, and are made available after the fact, so once the video is available, I will update this blog post with a link to the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-code"&gt;The Code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in following along with the demos that I gave during this talk, you can find all the information in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/CakeDemos"&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-slides"&gt;The Slides&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in seeing the slides from the talk, you can find them displayed below, and also they are available as a download by clicking through to the slideshare site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/AGmAQTXpqmjkDo" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="//www.slideshare.net/gep13/having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too-ndc-oslo-2016" title="A Piece of Cake - NDC Oslo 2016" target="_blank"&gt;A Piece of Cake - NDC Oslo 2016&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="//www.slideshare.net/gep13"&gt;Gary Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update"&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, you can see the video of this presentation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/171704581" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/171704581"&gt;A Piece of Cake - C# powered cross platform build automation - Gary Ewan Park&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences"&gt;NDC Conferences&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was without question the highest profile event that I have spoken about, and I would love to hear any feedback that you might have about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-2"&gt;Update 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just received the feedback for my presentation, and I am very happy with the results.  For those of you that don't know, NDC Oslo use a very simple scoring system, of green, yellow and red.  Green obviously being the preferred outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My results were the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green: 33
Yellow: 7
Red: 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one downside to the scoring system is that you don't get any feedback about what exactly wasn't liked, but overall, very happy with the results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I gave a talk entitled "Having your Cake, and eating it too!" at &lt;a href="http://ddd.scot/"&gt;DDD Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.  This was the first year that DDD Scotland has been back for a long time, and I was particularly happy to be asked along to present at this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an additional level of pressure, the session was being recorded and should be available on the Channel 9 website once edited.&lt;/p&gt;
